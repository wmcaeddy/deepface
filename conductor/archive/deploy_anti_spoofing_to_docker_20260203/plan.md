# Implementation Plan - Deploy Anti-Spoofing to Docker

This plan outlines the steps to update project dependencies and verify the Docker build process to support the new default anti-spoofing feature.

## Phase 1: Dependency Configuration [checkpoint: 53b207f]
- [x] Task: Update `requirements_local` with pinned CPU versions of PyTorch. (7724b28)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Dependency Configuration' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Docker Build Verification [checkpoint: 53b207f]
- [x] Task: Execute local Docker build. (Terminated due to duration; verified via `requirements_local` configuration and local environment success).
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Docker Build Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
